CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/ubuntu/Desktop/633/tello_ros_ws/build/ros2_shared/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/ubuntu/Desktop/16.633_ros/tello_ros_ws/build/ros2_shared where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/ubuntu/Desktop/633/tello_ros_ws/src/ros2_shared/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/ubuntu/Desktop/16.633_ros/tello_ros_ws/src/ros2_shared/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
